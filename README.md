I made this as a demonstration on how to use **Retrofit**, **Glide**, and **Realm** in about an hour; with absolutely paying **no** mind to app architecture and design patterns like MVP.

So the logic is all pretty much in `MainActivity`. Although as you can see in the commit logs, I did refactor a little, and add some more *features*.
